# DataStructures-Java
Data Structures written in Java

********I'm planning on sorting the wiki out for the current classes before moving on to coding any more data structures******

A lot of the code is over-commented (on purpose) in order to help people looking at the code understand where I'm coming from.
A lot of the comments have ended up in the wiki (same reason) so, there's plenty of repetition but, the wiki is much more in-depth than the comments and includes proofs where applicable.
HMU if you have any questions or if you spot any mistakes or have ideas on optimisation etc, I'm still (and always) learning.
